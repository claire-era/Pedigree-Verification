## Description
This project aims to identify which of the given F1 samples are true progenies. <strong>Current version: Only produces true out-crosses. Parent-to-offspring match is to follow.</strong>

## Dependencies
- This repository (Pedigree-Verification)
- `tassel-5-src`
                
1. Clone the repository by either calling `git clone https://github.com/InternationalRiceResearchInstitute/Pedigree-Verification` in the terminal <strong>OR</strong> clicking the `clone repository` button above.
2. Navigate to the location of the folder <strong>Pedigree-Verification</strong>.

### Installing tassel-5-src
1. Open a terminal, navigate to the location of the repository and run `git clone https://bitbucket.org/tasseladmin/tassel-足5-足source.git tassel5-足src`

### Two Ways of Execution
                
- `java -jar <.hmp.txt> <pedigree_file.txt>`
- `java -jar <.hmp.txt> <pedigree_file.txt> <cut_off>`
Or edit the script and run 
- `./start_default.sh` 
or 
- `./start_cutoff.sh`

##### Notes
- `cut_off` should be of data type `double`.
- If the script requires permission to access, run `chmod 777 <script_name>`. This enables all file operations on the script for the current user.
                
## Limitations

#### File Formats
- Gene sequencing file - Only the HapMap text file is currently allowed in this package. There'll be future implementations of the project that can read other gene sequencing file formats such as: VCF, HDF5, etc.
- Pedigree file - The format of the pedigree file strictly should be as follows:

dnarun_name	 | germplasm_name | germplasm_pedigree | germplasm_type | germplasm_par1 | germplasm_par1_type |	germplasm_par2 | germplasm_par2_type | nasample_sample_group | dnasample_sample_group_cycle

- Only HapMap files(.hmp.txt) can be used. Again, future implementations will be done in the future.

## For Developers
The use of an IDE *(Recommended: Eclipse Photon to latest)* is highly recommended for developers to properly segregate the Java libraries.

<strong>Folder Structure</strong>
Note: When used in an IDE, put the repository inside the <strong>eclipse-workspace</strong> folder.

```
PedigreeVerification/
  bin/pedigreeVerification/
    MutableTaxaList.class
    PedVerification.class
    PedigreeFileInfo.class
  src/pedigreeVerification/
    MutableTaxaList.java
    PedVerification.java
    PedigreeFileInfo.java
  tassel5-src
  .settings/
  .classpath
  .project
  README.md
  qc2.geno.hmp.txt
  qc2.sample_no_spaces.txt
  PedVer.jar
  start_default.sh
  start_cutoff.sh
  
```
Where:
- `Pedver.jar` is the Runnable JAR to be executed by the scripts.
- `qc2.geno.hmp.txt` is a sample HapMap file
- `qc2.sample_no_spaces.txt` is a sample pedigree file
- `start_default.sh` is the default script for running default parameters 
- `start_cutoff.sh` is the script with indicated cut-off of scores

## CHANGE LOG

- Install rJava and JRI
- Integrate rJava inside Run Configurations and fix R_HOME Path inside eclipse environment
- Use of fisher.test() inside JVM
